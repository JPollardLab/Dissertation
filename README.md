## Single-cell RNA sequencing data
Single-cell RNA sequencing data collected by Wu et al (2021) (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00911-1) can be found at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE176078. Data was utilized for an exemplar workflow of single-cell annotation. Original author annotations were used for the construction of synthetic data via Synthspot and an exemplar run of RCTD deconvolution for breast cancer tissue downloaded from 10XGenomics database (link to database shown below). 
## Breast Cancer tissue data used for RCTD
Breast cancer tissue used for the RCTD deconvolution was obtained from the 10XGenomics database can be found here https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/fresh-frozen-visium-on-cytassist-human-breast-cancer-probe-based-whole-transcriptome-profiling-2-standard
